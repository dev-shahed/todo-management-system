# Todo Management System

## Overview
The Todo Management System is a web application developed using React for the frontend and Spring Boot for the backend. It allows users to manage their todos, with administrative privileges for certain actions limited to admin users. The primary goal of this project is to learn and implement Spring Security for user authentication and authorization.

## Features
- User authentication: Users can register, login, and logout securely.
- Todo management: Users can view, create, update, and delete their todos.
- Role-based access control: Only admin users can perform update and delete operations on todos.
- Secure API endpoints: Implementing Spring Security ensures that API endpoints are protected from unauthorized access.
- Responsive UI: The frontend is built using React, ensuring a responsive and intuitive user interface.
